### Prompt 1

can you review the wave 1 specs in the openspec/ folder, and then can you go through the TDD preparation phase up until we have tests, variable and function names, and docstrings if appropriate? i'll deploy a different model to write the code. start by creating beads tickets for the task phases so we can decompose that out to subagents.

### Prompt 2

continue

### Prompt 3

make me a mise task that gives me a human readable output of the current test suite state, and what should i expect to see in it?
